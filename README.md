## Technology Stack

The AirBnB Clone project uses a variety of technologies to ensure robustness, scalability, and performance. Below is an overview of the key technologies used:

### Django
- **Purpose**: Django is a high-level Python web framework that is used to build the core backend of the AirBnB Clone. It simplifies the development process by providing built-in tools for building secure, maintainable web applications. In this project, Django is used to create the RESTful API.

### Django REST Framework
- **Purpose**: Django REST Framework (DRF) is a toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. It provides features like serializers, authentication, and view sets, which are crucial for creating APIs for user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

### PostgreSQL
- **Purpose**: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system used to store and manage all the data for the AirBnB Clone project. It provides advanced features like transactions, indexing, and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and fast query performance.

### GraphQL
- **Purpose**: GraphQL is a flexible query language used to interact with the backend data. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need and nothing more. In this project, GraphQL is integrated to enable efficient and customizable data fetching, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

### Celery
- **Purpose**: Celery is an asynchronous task queue that is used to handle background tasks in the project. It is used for tasks like sending notifications, processing payments, and handling other long-running processes without blocking the main application.

### Redis
- **Purpose**: Redis is an in-memory data store used for caching and session management in this project. It helps improve the performance of the application by caching frequently accessed data and reducing the load on the PostgreSQL database.

### Docker
- **Purpose**: Docker is a containerization tool that is used to create a consistent development and deployment environment. It allows the backend application and its dependencies to run seamlessly across different environments, from development to production.

### CI/CD Pipelines
- **Purpose**: Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines are used to automate the process of testing and deploying code changes. This ensures that code is always tested before being deployed, improving code quality and reducing the risk of bugs.

## Database Design

The database for the AirBnB Clone project is structured to handle key entities such as Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, and Payments. Below is an overview of each entity and their key fields:

### Users
- **Fields**:
  - `id`: A unique identifier for the user.
  - `email`: User's email address, used for authentication.
  - `password`: Encrypted password for authentication.
  - `first_name`: User's first name.
  - `last_name`: User's last name.
  - `date_joined`: The date the user registered.
- **Relationships**:
  - A user can have multiple properties.
  - A user can make multiple bookings.

### Properties
- **Fields**:
  - `id`: A unique identifier for the property.
  - `user_id`: A foreign key linking the property to a specific user (host).
  - `title`: Title of the property listing.
  - `description`: Detailed description of the property.
  - `price_per_night`: The cost for renting the property per night.
- **Relationships**:
  - Each property belongs to a single user (host).
  - A property can have multiple bookings and reviews.

### Bookings
- **Fields**:

  - `user_id`: A foreign key linking the booking to a specific user (guest).
  - `property_id`: A foreign key linking the booking to a specific property.
  - `check_in`: The check-in date for the booking.
  - `check_out`: The check-out date for the booking.
  - `total_price`: Total cost of the booking.

  - `payment_method`: The method used for payment (e.g., credit card, PayPal).
  - `amount`: The total payment amount.
  - `payment_date`: The date the payment was made.
- **Relationships**:
  - A payment is associated with one booking.
  - A booking can only have one payment.

These entities are designed to work together to ensure that users can register, list properties, make bookings, leave reviews, and process payments within the system.

## Feature Breakdown

The AirBnB Clone project includes several core features that are essential for creating a functional platform for users and hosts. Below is a breakdown of the main features:

### User Management
- **Description**: The user management system allows users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles. It ensures that each user has a secure account and can track their interactions with the platform, such as property listings, bookings, and reviews.

### Property Management
- **Description**: This feature enables hosts to list their properties, providing details such as title, description, pricing, and availability. Users can view property listings and decide which properties meet their needs, while hosts can update and manage their listings easily.

### Booking System
- **Description**: The booking system allows users to reserve properties for specific dates, managing check-in, check-out details, and payment transactions. It ensures that the property is available for the selected dates and records booking details to ensure proper management of reservations.

### Payment Processing
- **Description**: Integrated payment functionality processes transactions related to bookings. This system ensures secure handling of payments, providing an efficient mechanism for users to pay for their reservations while also recording payment details for the hosts.

### Review System
- **Description**: The review system enables users to leave ratings and feedback on properties they have stayed at. This helps future users make informed decisions based on past guest experiences and allows hosts to improve their offerings based on feedback.

### Database Optimization
